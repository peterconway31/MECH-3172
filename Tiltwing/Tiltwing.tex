\subsection{Tilt Wing}
%Description about it
A tilt-wing (or tilt-tail) mechanism is a common feature of numerous conceptual designs, including the two conceptual designs being pursued for prototyping.  

\subsubsection{Theory}
%What is required by the system
Tilt-wing UAVs incorporate a novel system that presents various beneficial design properties and performance merits. Research focus on developing aircraft with long-distance efficiency and VTOL capabilities has highlighted the effective use of tilt-rotors and tilt-wings by allowing motors to be used in both flight configurations, improving power efficiency and reducing unnecessary weight. Rotating the wing in parallel with the motor provides important mechanical benefits however, resulting in the tilt-wing design offering certain advantages over tilt-rotors. \\

One advantage is that the power loss due to the wings interference with propeller slipstreams is minimised. Tilt-wing design allows the slipstream from the rotor to strike the smallest possible frontal area of the wing, resulting in fewer power efficiency losses when lifting the aircraft. This is demonstrated by the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor losing about 10\% of its thrust to interference from the wings \note{(Cite)}{}. Experimental tilt-wing testing demonstrates that the total wing drag is only 4\% of the propeller thrust compared to 27\% for a tilt-rotor configuration \note{(Cite)}{}. This improved efficiency proves crucial to reducing energy consumption on small to medium scale UAVs which have inherently limited power storage. Additionally, the tilt mechanism allows control during VTOL and has the potential for control during horizontal flight. This reduces the weight and power requirements of the aircraft by eliminating the need for or reducing the size of control surfaces.\\

A tilt-wing design also has the potential to improve aerodynamics. In VTOL, the frontal area of the entire aircraft is minimised by orienting the wings such that their leading edges cut through the incoming air. Additionally, a tilt-wing mechanism can be stored within the fuselage, as opposed to common tilt motor designs which have exposed mechanisms for each rotor, adding to aerodynamic drag. \\

To ensure the advantages of a tilt-wing configuration are leveraged, a variety of VTOL and forward flight system requirements have been generated. The VTOL and forward flight configurations are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:configs}.\\

    \label{fig:configs}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{VTOL System Requirements}
In the stationary hovering state, the angle of the wings relative to the body \(\theta_w\) will be approximately \(90\degree\) (zero along the $x$-axis). For control in the VTOL configuration, the tilt mechanism must be capable of inducing a positive and negative yawing moment on the UAV. To achieve this, the wings, and therefore the thrust of the wing-mounted motors, will need to be individually actuated and have a range of rotation beyond 90\degree. The maximum achievable angle will depend on the control scheme but is unlikely to exceed 135\degree. \note{source}{} \\
\note{Rhys}{Mentions battery voltage requirement}

\paragraph{VTOL Transition System Requirements}
To achieve a controlled transition between the two flight modes, the transition phase will need to be rapid. Both wings will be required to tilt from an angle of approximately \(\theta_w=90\degree\) to approximately \(\theta_w=0\degree\) in unison and at the same rate. A separate single tilt mechanism, with rapid actuation, may be required for this.\\

\paragraph{Forward Flight System Requirements}
\note{Rhys}{Take about if the design will require 1 or 2 tilt systems and if they both have to be individually actuated}\\
To allow the tilt-wing mechanism to be utilised for control during horizontal flight, a high degree of structural integrity and rotational angle accuracy is required. A design with a reliable and stable mechanism, with minimal moving parts is therefore desired. To allow control in forward flight and to eliminate the need of additional control surfaces, both wings will be required to have a tilt angle of approximately \(\theta_w=\pm5\degree\). Furthermore, due to increased cruise velocities and generally larger forces acting on the UAV during horizontal flight to VTOL transition, the tilt mechanism must be capable of withstanding large drag induced torques. Flight forces exceeding the maximum design torque of the tilt-wing will likely result in catastrophic failure. 

\subsubsection{Methodology}
A simplified analytical approach is taken to determine the external forces and resultant moments acing on the isolated tilt-wing mechanism. Understanding the potential moments around the $y$-axis will inform the design of the mechanism by indicating the required structural integrity and informing the operational requirements of potential actuating systems such as motors or servos. Moments around the $x$-axis and the $z$-axis are not as critical to the design of the tilt mechanism as the radial and axial loads they produce can be isolated through sturdy fuselage design and effective spar support through the use of bearings.

\subsubsection{Analysis}
A reference coordinate system relative to the body of the aircraft was generated to indicate the direction of acting forces. The origin of this coordinate system is indicated as $O$, and represents the center of the main spar, not the center of mass. Additionally, it is assumed that each wing has an individual central main spar running spanwise perpendicular to the fuselage. \\

\paragraph{Forward Flight Configuration Modeling}
Figure \ref{fig:FFFBD} shows a static free body diagram of a tilt-wing during forward flight configuration. The averaged lift and drag forces of each aerofoil are functions of the linear velocities of the aircraft in the $x$ and $z$ directions, and the wing angle of attack. It is assumed that these forces act on the main spar ($y$-axis) of each wing and hence do not induce a moment around the $y$-axis at the origin. The forces produced by the port and starboard motors are assumed to act in the $x$ direction but along the $y$-axis and therefore do not produce a moment around the $y$-axis. The mass of the motors will cause a small moment around the $y$-axis, but this will likely be small compared moments cause by external disturbances such as winds and gusts.\\

    \caption{Static Forward Flight FBD of external forces and moments acting on an isolated tilt-wing system}
    \label{fig:FFFBD}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{VTOL Configuration Modeling}
The static free body diagram of the VTOL configuration is depicted in Figure \ref{VTOLFBD}. It displays similar forces as the forward flight configuration but in different orientations with respect to the coordinate system. The averaged lift and drag forces of each aerofoil are dependent on the vertical velocity in the $z$ direction. When hovering with a constant altitude these force are zero, but will develop with increasing vertical velocity. Similarly to the forward flight configuration, these forces are assumed to act along the main spars of each wing and hence do not induce a moment around the $y$-axis.\\

    \caption{Static VTOL FBD showing the external forces and moments acting on an isolated tilt-wing system}
    \label{fig:VTOLFBD}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Worst Case Scenario Modeling}
The various forces and resultant moments of the two static configurations indicate minor torsional loads on the tilt-wing mechanism. During dynamic flight and VTOL transition the tilt mechanism will experience a larger spectrum of moments with greater amplitude. These will be created by shifting aerodynamic forces produced by the wings, external disturbances such as wind gusts and wing drag induced by VTOL transitioning. To simplify the modeling of such forces, a worst case scenario is considered. The torsional load of this scenario will occur when the aircraft suddenly transitions from forward flight to VTOL. In this scenario the two wings will quickly rotate from an angle of \(\theta_w=0\degree\) to \(\theta_w=90\degree\) relative to the body. The aerodynamic drag due to such a maneuver will induce large moments on the tilt mechanism.\\

By assuming the wings can be modeled as as a flat plate, the drag force can be calculated using Equation \ref{eqn:drag}.
\begin{equation}
    D=\frac{1}{2}C_D\rho v^2S \label{eqn:drag}
\end{equation}
% Where;
% \begin{eqnarray*}
%     C_D &=& \textnormal{coefficient of drag}\\
%     \rho &=& \textnormal{air density}\:[kg/m^3]\\
%     v &=& \textnormal{velocity of UAV}\:[m/s]\\
%     S &=& \textnormal{approximate surface area of the underside of the wing} \:[m^2]
% \end{eqnarray*}
\note{JAKE+TOM}{Rhys we need to discuss this paragraph}
The coefficient of drag is a function of several parameters including the shape of the body, Reynolds number of the flow, Froude number, Mach number and roughness of the surface. For simplification however the coefficient of drag of a flat plate perpendicular to the fluid flow was found from literature to equal 1.17. The desinsty of air is assumed to equal 1.225 \(kg/m^3\), assuming the VTOL transition occurs close to the ground. For the worse case scenario, the velocity of the UAV is found from analysis to equal 28 m/s. Lastly the approximate surface area of the underside of the wing is calculated from analysis based on the wing loading and take of weight (\ref{}). The

    \therefore\quad D=1.17\times \frac{1}{2}\times 1.225\times 28^2\times 0.7

The system requirements identified that tilt angles ranging between \(-5\degree<\theta_w<135\degree\) are required for full control in both VTOL and forward flight. Therefore the angular rotation of an actuation system must be capable of at least \(140\degree\) rotation.  \\
\\
\textbf{Actuating Motor Selection}\\

* Table of potentual servos (TS170 high torque digital RC servos with 18 kgcm torque) \\
\\
Three common motors types are considered to actuate the tilt-wing mechanism. These include; brushed and brush-less DC motors, stepper motors and positional rotation servo motors. The system requirements and design requirements are used determine which is most suitable.\\
\\
The angle of rotation required by the actuating motor must be \(140\degree\leqslant\theta_w\leqslant180\degree\). This requirement eliminates the use of brushed/brush-less DC motors which provide continuous rotation. Positional awareness with high angular accuracy is also required, supporting the use of stepper motors and DC positional rotation servo motors. Although stepper motors can accurately rotate with a high pole count ranging from 50 to 100, they too are intended for large angular rotation. Further more they have the potential to skip a pole, resulting in skewed accuracy. Their current consumption is also independent of load and hence constantly draw maximum current. DC positional rotation servos allow \(90\degree\) rotation in either direction for a total of \(180\degree\) movement, aligning well with the system requirements. A potentiometer coupled with a control circuit uses pulse width modulation (PWM) signals to control the position of the servo. This feedback system allows the servo to constantly correct any drift from the intended location. Servos are also generally able to generate higher peak torques than the holding torque of a stepper motor and are often smaller and more current efficient. In conclusion DC positional rotation servos are most applicable for the tilt-wing mechanism. \\
\\
A large range of servos with varying torque ratings, construction materials and angular speeds exist. A range of servos that meet the required torque of ??? are displayed in Table \ref{}. \\
\\
Due to the servos importance to the system, only servos with metal gears were considered as nylon gear pose the risk of stripping.\\
\\
\textbf{Preliminary Tilt Mechanism Design}\\
Based on the selection of a ??? servo, a preliminary prototype tilt-wing mechanism was designed. This prototype is a scaled version, designed to accommodate a Turnigy R5180MG analog servo. Due to the small servo size, the prototype was 3D printed for inspection and scaled operation testing. The mechanism allows for individual actuation of both wing spars, with a maximum servo rotation of \(180\degree\), easily meeting the angular rotation requirement of \(\theta_w\). Furthermore the system isolates the radial and axial loads of the wings through the use of bearings and allows for a modular wing design in which the wings can easily be detached from the system. Lastly, the mechanism can easily be modified to use one servo to actuate a single spar spanning two wings which do not require individual actuation. An isometric view of the mechanism is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:render} and additional CAD drawings can be found in Appendix \ref{}.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}
%The moment caused by the aerodynamic drag of the vertical wings can indicate that actuating motors or servos must have a torque requirements exceeding

\subsubsection{Future Work}
Additional testing of the prototype tilt-wing mechanism is required to ensure intended functionality and full range of motion. Subject to necessary modifications, designs can then begin for a full scaled prototype. This new prototype will be scaled up to house larger ??? servos, bearings and actual wing spars. Further discussion with the workshop will also be required to discuss manufacturing difficulties and tolerances. Once the full scale prototype is complete, an iterative testing and modification stage can commence. Torque testing using a torque wrench or spring force meter will be used in this phase to test the rated holding torque of the servos and system as a whole. Once the tilt-wing mechanism is operational and near optimal, further analysis using Datcom and potentially a wind tunnel can be used to experiment with wing angles of attack to optimise the efficiency and control of the system in all flight configurations.
