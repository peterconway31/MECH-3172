abstract = {This paper describes a family of innovative fixed wing UAS with can vertical take off and land - the SONGBIRD family. With nominal payloads starting from 0.5 kg they can take off and land safely like a multi-rotor UAV, removing the need for an airstrip for the critical phases of operation. A specially designed flight controller allows stable flight at every point of the transition phase between VTOL and fixed wing mode. Because of this smooth process with a all time stable flight, very expensive payload like hyperspectral sensors or advanced optical cameras can be used. Due to their design all airplanes of the SONGBIRD family have excellent horizontal flight properties, a maximum speed of over 110 km/h, good gliding properties and long flight times of up to 1 h. Missions were flown in wind speeds up to 18 m/s. At every time of the flight it is possible to interrupt the mission and hover over a point of interest for detail investigations. The complete flight, including take-off and landing...},

abstract = {An aerodynamic analysis of a ducted fan for vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicles was performed using computational simulation. A commercial computational fluid dynamics tool was used to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The calculated results were validated in the subsonic wind tunnel at Hanyang University. The objective of this study is to investigate the aerodynamic performance of a ducted fan in crosswinds. The thrust, normal and side forces of the ducted fan are affected by the velocity magnitude and in-flow angle of the crosswind. The pitching moment of the ducted fan is significantly influenced by the crosswind due to asymmetric lift force created by the difference in suction velocity magnitude on the duct lip. Flow separation at the duct lip occurs under hovering and crosswind conditions. The inlet flow fields of the ducted fan are distorted by the duct lip separation. In conclusion, to improve the stability of the ducted fan, the pitching moment...},
