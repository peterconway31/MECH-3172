\subsection{Stakeholders}

The stakeholders of the project are individuals, organisations and societal groups which have interest in, and/or influence the project. The stakeholders along with their interaction with the project are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:stakeholder}. The relation of the stakeholders are listed in Table \ref{tab:sdl}. CASA regulate the operation of aircraft within Australia which directly effect the internal project development group. Other stakeholders include the honours team who will perform the research, design and assembly of the system. The intellectual property is owned by Lockheed Martin STELaRLab, with Dr Tim Payne and Dr Scott Beinke providing mentorship and in-kind support to the project. The university academic appointed to supervise the project is Dr Rey Chin. Other stakeholders include the University of Adelaide and Australian emergency fire services such as the CFS.

The stakeholder interest influence matrix, in Figure \ref{fig:stakeholdermatrix} depicts the relation between stakeholder project interest and stakeholder influence resulting in how they should be managed. Stakeholders with high interest and influence such as team members, the project supervisor and sponsors fall into the key stakeholder section of the matrix and are to be managed closely. The identified Key Stakeholders will have their inputs prioritised throughout the project. Stakeholders with high influence and low interest such as the Government and CASA need to be kept informed throughout the duration of the project to ensure compliance with appropriate regulations. Stakeholders with high interest and low influence include persons that the system effects such as those impacted by bushfires and need to be considered throughout the design process.
